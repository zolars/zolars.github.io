# Abstract

financial Sentiment Chart aims to analyse influence between social sentiment and financial tendency. This is a cooperation project with [Oscar Osborne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscarosborne), Ph.D of the University of New South Wales.

This project uses scraper with high performance to get large scale data of tweets. With these data, run sentiment analysis in order to generate a realtime update chart. The raw data is also saved in database, which may provide further analysis.

# Objective

To develop a platform which gathers live financial data and social network/online information/media information which will be displayed in a HTML format. The dataset will be used to analyze the relationship between online social sentiment of a certain stock, share, currency, crypto, and that stock price over a period of time.

Basically, this data aims to find is how social sentiment impacts price of:

* Stock exchanges
  * Shares within those exchanges
* Global currencies
* Crypto currencies

In order to find the social sentiment of a stock, the program will use keywords to identify that the social media post is actually talking about that stock. I think that the best way to classify whether the post is speaking about a financial stock would be through the stock abbreviation code, the name of the stock or the name of the CEO, etc.

What's more, this Web application is built as a financial analysis tool. Consequently, I hope that **anyone whether owned programming experiences or not**, can easily run and deploy this service.

# Implementation

I made a realtime scraper with high performance in order to catch data from [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) and [Weibo](https://www.weibo.com). The data is saved in MySQL database and execute sentiment analysis with a pipeline.

After that, I build a light-wight Web application with Python Flask and ECharts. The application can be easily deployed on any server with python environment and it can run realtime, stably and automatically. I will give you the deploy method.

# Usage

1. Get the code from Github clone or download zip by clicking [this](https://github.com/zolars/financial-sentiment/archive/master.zip).
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/zolars/financial-sentiment.git
    ```

2. You need to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) on your computer.
    ```
    $ conda -V
    conda 4.7.10
    ```

    You need to set "123456" as the MySQL password. Or change the password in the code.

    ```
    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password:123456
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    ```

3. Create the environment.
    ```
    $ cd financial-sentiment
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ conda activate finance
    $ python -V
    Python 3.6.8 :: Anaconda, Inc. 
    ```

    If you want to update your environment, use:
    ```
    $ conda env update -f environment.yml
    ```

4. Download dependencies.
    ```
    $ python -m textblob.download_corpora
    ```

5. Create a new DATABASE with MySQL.
    ```
    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password:123456
    mysql> create DATABASE posts;
    mysql> use posts;
    Database changed
    ```

6. Run the app
    ```
    $ cd financial-sentiment
    $ conda activate finance
    $ python app.py
    ```

# Problems

I tried to deploy this server on my laboratory's workstations and made them work as a cluster. However, low performance in high concurrency circumstances, as the main problem currently, has bothered me. (Though the architecture is so naiveü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) The key point was that classic high concurrency method cannot be easily used to Twitter due to the flow limitations for each IP accessing to Twitter. An software architect may solve this problem, I think. For me, I need some further study or read more paper on this area.
