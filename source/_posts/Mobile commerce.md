Mobile commerce means the delivery of electronic commerce capabilities directly into the consumer’s hand via wireless technology. It also means a retail outlet in your customer’s pocket.

Without any doubt, the most important feature of the mobile commerce is mobile access. <!--more-->Mobile access is the basic means to connect your mobile device to the Internet, which allows you to trade everywhere. Secondly, as each number of a SIM card is unique, it’s easy to identify you, that is a powerful means to guarantee your personal safety. The next one is mobile payment.

Mobile commerce has many advantages. First of all, Mobile-commerce-related services developed rapidly in early 2000, such as mobile parking payments, mobile purchases of airline and train tickets and so on. And the service has made our life more convenient. Secondly, mobile commerce is being utilized by physical retailers as a way to compete with the lower prices typically seen through online retailers, which means customers can get more reasonable price for the goods. Because mobile commerce has so many advantages, it’s being used in many areas, such as mobile money transfer, mobile ticketing and so on.

However, the shortage is also obvious. Mobile commerce is the latest offerings from telecoms operators. This comes with an increased risk of fraud and revenue leakage. Revenue leakage is revenue loss due to incorrect pricing, missing transactions, operational inefficiencies, transactions that haven’t been priced, uncollected revenues, etc. To minimize revenue leakage, an agreements-based billing and compensation solution can help customers plug several of the leakage holes. What’s more, providing better control over pricing and fees, precision on how fees are calculated for customers, partners, and suppliers will enable more efficient revenue assurance techniques. 

The significance of mobile commerce is obvious. E-commerce is important because it is worth US$230 billion, with Asia representing almost half of the market, and has been forecast to reach US$700 billion in 2017. M-commerce can make great progress. Reflecting the importance of m-Commerce, in April 2012 the Competition Commissioner of the European Commission ordered an in-depth investigation of the m-Commerce joint venture between Vodafone, O2, Orange and T-Mobile. A recent survey suggests that 2012, 41% of smartphone customers have purchased retail products with their mobile devices.
